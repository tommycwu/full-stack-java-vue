    <b>Make sure you have read the entire Case Study before attempting the tasks in this Use Case.</b>
</p>
<p>1. Create the following IP Network Zone:</p>
<p>
    <b>Label:</b> Corporate Network
    <br />
    <b>IP:</b> 100.100.100.0
</p>
<p>
    2. For MFA Factor Types, activate Okta Verify with Push (no Touch ID) and a Security Question.
</p>
<p>
    3. For MFA Enrollment, define a policy that only applies to the Interns group, in which Okta Verify with Push is an optional factor and a Security Question is required. Set up MFA enrollment to force enrollment on the next Okta login regardless of location.
</p>
<p>
    4. Define a policy in Okta that only applies to interns so that they are challenged for MFA every time they log in to Okta from outside of the Corporate Network.
</p>
<p>
    5. Confirm the following flows are experienced by <b>Mike</b> and <b>Meena</b> when they sign into Okta.
</p>
<p>
    <b>NOTE:</b> The following flows expect that neither <b>Mike</b> nor <b>Meera</b> are enrolled in any MFA factors.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Mike's Flow</b>
    <br />
    <br />
    Mike will log in to Okta with his credentials. He will be prompted to enroll in MFA. He will be required to set up a Security question but will have the option to set up Okta Verify. Mike will enroll in the Security Question and define “Okta” as the answer to the question selected. Mike will <b>NOT</b> be forced to enroll into Okta Verify, because this factor was set up as optional. Mike will <b>NOT</b> configure Okta Verify as the optional factor. After the successful login, Mike will test access to org2. When he clicks the Okta Org2Org icon on the Okta Dashboard, there will be no prompt for MFA. When Mike logs out of Okta and logs back in, he will <b>NOT</b> be in the Corporate Office network zone because your testing device does <b>NOT</b> have an IP of 100.100.100.0. Mike will be prompted to satisfy an MFA challenge to sign in to Okta. Mike will answer the MFA challenge by entering “Okta” as the answer to the presented Security Question he enrolled in earlier. After the successful login, Mike will test org2 access again. When he clicks the Okta Org2Org icon on the Okta Dashboard, there will be no prompt for MFA. Mike will then log out of Okta.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Meera's Flow</b><br />
    <br />
    When Meera logs in to Okta she is <b>NOT</b> prompted to enroll in MFA and is <b>NOT</b> required to satisfy an MFA challenge.
