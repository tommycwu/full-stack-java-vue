<p>Duration: 10 - 20 minutes</p>
<p>1. Create the following IP Network Zone:</p>
<p>
    <b>Label:</b> Corporate Network<br />
    <b>IP:</b> 100.100.100.0
</p>
<p>2. For MFA Factors Types, activate <b>Okta Verify</b> with Push (no Touch ID) and a <b>Security Question.</b></p>
<p>
    3. For MFA Enrollment, define a policy that only applies to <b>Interns</b> where Okta Verify with Push is an optional factor and a Security Question is required. Set up MFA enrollment to force enrollment on the next Okta login
    regardless of location.
</p>
<p>4. Define a policy in Okta that only applies to Interns so that they are challenged for MFA every time they log in to Okta from outside of the Corporate Network.</p>
<p>5. Confirm the following flows are experienced by <b>Mike</b> and <b>Sanjay</b> when they sign into Okta.</p>
<p>
    <b>NOTE:</b>
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Mike's Flow</b><br />
    <br />
    The following flows expect that neither Mike nor Sanjay are enrolled in any MFA factors:<br />
    <br />
    <b>Mike</b> will log in to Okta with his credentials. He will be prompted to enroll into MFA. He will be forced to set up a Security Question but will have the option to set up Okta Verify. Mike will enroll in the Security Question and
    define <b>Okta</b> as the answer to the question selected. Mike will <b>NOT</b> be forced to enroll into Okta Verify, because this factor was set up as optional. Mike will <b>NOT</b> configure Okta Verify as the optional factor. After
    the successful login, Mike will test Salesforce access. When he clicks on the Salesforce icon via the Okta Dashboard, there will be <b>no</b> prompt for MFA. When Mike logs out of Okta and Salesforce and logs back in to Okta, he will
    <b>NOT</b> be in the Corporate Office (Network Zone), since your testing device does <b>NOT</b> have an IP of 100.100.100.0 and he will be prompted to satisfy an MFA challenge to sign in to Okta. Mike will answer the MFA challenge by
    entering <b>Okta</b> as the answer to the presented Security Question he enrolled into earlier. After the successful login, Mike will re-test Salesforce access. When he clicks on the Salesforce icon via the Okta Dashboard, there will be
    <b>no</b> prompt for MFA. Mike will log out of Okta and Salesforce.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Sanjay's Flow</b><br />
    <br />
    When <b>Sanjay</b> logs in to Okta he is <b>NOT</b> prompted to enroll into MFA nor is he required to satisfy an MFA challenge.
