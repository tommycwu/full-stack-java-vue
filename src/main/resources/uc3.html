<p><b>Please make sure you have read the entire Case Study before attemping the tasks in this Use Case.</b></p>
<p>1. Create the following IP Network Zone:</p>
<p>
    <b>Label:</b> Corporate Network<br />
    <b>IP:</b> 100.100.100.0
</p>
<p>2. For MFA Factors Types, activate <b>Okta Verify</b> with Push (no Touch ID) and a <b>Security Question.</b></p>
<p>
    3. For MFA Enrollment, define a policy that only applies to <b>Interns</b> where Okta Verify with Push is an optional factor and a Security Question is required. Set up MFA enrollment to force enrollment on the next Okta login
    regardless of location.
</p>
<p>4. Define a policy in Okta that only applies to Interns so that they are challenged for MFA every time they log in to Okta from outside of the Corporate Network.</p>
<p>5. Confirm the following flows are experienced by <b>Mike</b> and <b>Sanjay</b> when they sign into Okta.</p>
<p>
    <b>NOTE:</b>
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Mike's Flow</b><br />
    <br />
    The following flows expect that neither Mike nor Sanjay are enrolled in any MFA factors:<br />
    <br />
    <b>Mike</b> will log in to Okta with his credentials. He will be prompted to enroll into MFA. He will be forced to set up a Security Question but will have the option to set up Okta Verify. Mike will enroll in the Security Question and define <b>Okta</b> as the answer to the question selected. Mike will NOT be forced to enroll into Okta Verify, because this factor was set up as optional. Mike will <b>NOT</b> configure Okta Verify as the optional factor. After the successful login, Mike will test access to the spoke org. When he clicks on the org2org icon via the Okta Dashboard, there will be no prompt for MFA. When Mike logs out of Okta and logs back in, he will <b>NOT</b> be in the Corporate Office (Network Zone), since your testing device does <b>NOT</b> have an IP of 100.100.100.0 and he will be prompted to satisfy an MFA challenge to sign in to Okta. Mike will answer the MFA challenge by entering <b>Okta</b> as the answer to the presented Security Question he enrolled into earlier. After the successful login, Mike will re-test spoke org access. When he clicks on the org2org icon via the Okta Dashboard, there will be no prompt for MFA. Mike will log out of Okta.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Sanjay's Flow</b><br />
    <br />
    When <b>Sanjay</b> logs in to Okta he is <b>NOT</b> prompted to enroll into MFA nor is he required to satisfy an MFA challenge.
